            Hey! My name is Jacob. I am an SAP developer specializing in CPI/BTP and ABAP development, formerly @ delaware North America. I have experience developing iFlows both on-prem and NS2, as well as creating & testing ABAP proxies in S/4 HANA. Currently working on my C_CPI_15 and C_ABAPD_2309 certs, so expect to see those listed here by the end of the year!
        </p>
        <p>
            I graduated Cum Laude with a B.S. in Computer Science from Arizona State University, and currently reside in Montana.

            In my personal time, I love reading, playing <a href="https://online-go.com/user/view/1260955">Go</a> (~13kyu), doing the NYT crossword, and collecting records.
            Check out some of my work below! And consider me for your open position?
