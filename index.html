            Hey all! My name is Jake. I am currently a B.S. senior and master's candidate at Arizona State University, studying computer science. I (used to) work in the 
            <a href="https://xr.asu.edu/">
            Immersive Creation Studio
            </a>
             @ ASU as a creative developer. I am now looking for full-time dev work!
        </p>
        <p>
            My focus is currently cybersecurity, but I have recently fallen in love with networking. In my personal time, I love playing with APIs and creating networked applets.
        </p>
        <p>
            My dream is to work on microservices! I am a stickler for the fine details, and with that comes an obsession with debugging, runtime optimization, and good programming practices. No, I am not joking about debugging. I can step through code for hours without a worry in the world. 
            Check out some of my work below!
