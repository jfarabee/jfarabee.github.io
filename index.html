            My name is Jake, I'm a student at Arizona State University, studying computer science with a passion for cybersecurity. I enjoy programming in C, C++, Java, and Python. On the side I do Rust for fun, and brainf*ck for the challenge. I'm deeply in love with cybersecurity, and spend a lot of time reading about personal privacy, anonymity, and cybersurveillance mitigations. I hope to work in network security and threat response one day (in the near future). Hire me? I would really appreciate it.
